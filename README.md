# M5Stack_CardKB_ESP32-S3
M5Stack CardKB used with ESP32-S3 as a USB or Bluetooth Keyboard. Xiao ESP32-S3 or QTPY ESP32-S3
Things to note:
- If youre connecting the CardKB directly with I2C on the QTPY STEMMA port remember to change WIRE with WIRE1
- Bluetooth program wont run unless you heavily modify your library folder. eventually i will upload the library modifications.
- all keys work, i need to add a way to input CTRL in the keyboard but have not figured out how to yet. 
This project was done out of necessity for a small/thin portable keyboard to interact with my Pi
