# M5Stack_CardKB_ESP32-S3
M5Stack CardKB used with ESP32-S3 as a USB or Bluetooth Keyboard. Xiao ESP32-S3 or QTPY ESP32-S3

-This is a project that aims to use the M5Stack Keyboard as a wired/wireless keyboard. 

Things to note:
- If youre connecting the CardKB directly with I2C on the QTPY STEMMA port remember to change WIRE with WIRE1
- all keys work. Control key is mapped to Fn
  
This project was done out of necessity for a small/thin portable keyboard to interact with my Pi
